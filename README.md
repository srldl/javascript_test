Create a map using leaflet and leaflet-draw.

If coord are submitted to the map, draw them on the map.

If drawing is enabled, you may also fetch a point, line, bounding-box or track
from the map drawing.

The option of drawing on the map can be turned off or on depending on
whether you want to display coordinates only or update with new ones as well.

This component is now a widget under https://github.com/npolar/mapdraw.js.
